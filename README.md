# Rigol DS1000E and DS1000Z series oscilloscope waveform library

This is a fork of the work done by Blaicher and Szkutnik to create a command-line utility for converting Rigol waveform files to other formats.  The primary purpose of this fork is to create a module that can be installed via `pip`
```
    pip install RigolWFM
```

Once this is done, one can extract signals from binary Rigol `.wfm` files easily
```
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import RigolWFM.wfm as wfm
    
    t, y = wfm.signals("OneChannelFile.wfm")
    plt.plot(t,y)
    plt.show()
    
    t, y1, y2 = wfm.signals("TwoChannelFile.wfm")
    plt.plot(t,y)
    plt.show()
```

## Rigol DS1000E Scopes

The parsing code to read these `.wfm` files from these scopes is written by Blaicher at (pyRigolWFM)[https://github.com/mabl/pyRigolWFM].  The code has been tested by me to work on files from the DS1102E and DS1052E.

## Rigol DS1000Z

The parsing code to read these `.wfm` files from these scopes is written by Szkutnik at (pyRigolWFM)[https://github.com/mabl/pyRigolWFM].  Since I don't have one of these scopes the code is currently untested.  However, since I really did not touch the parsing code I expect it should still work. Szkutnik does make a couple of point

1. the calculated voltage values are wrong
2. the WFM file format changes with firm.  Only versions 00.04.01.SP2, 00.04.02.SP4 and 00.04.03.SP2 have been tested by Szkutnik
3. the logic analyzer functions

The DS1000Z should cover encompass following Rigol devices:

* DS1054Z
* DS1074Z
* DS1104Z
* DS1074Z-S
* DS1104Z-S
* MSO1074Z
* MSO1104Z
* MSO1074Z-S
* MSO1104Z-S

## Rigol DS1000C and DS1000D

Unfortunately there is no python code, but in the `doc` directory are C and Matlab codes to parse `.wfm` files for those scopes.
